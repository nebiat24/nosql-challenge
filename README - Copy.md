Multiple sources such as: I referenced official Bootcamp course material and documentation; instructor teaching (classes & shared resources), aid from fellow students, Google Search, StackOverflow, W3C Schools, content as well as support and guidance from the Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT. In particular I spent the primary amount of my time reviewing the official MongoDB documentation located on its site here: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo/ especially around the areas of aggregation documentation as required by this exercise.
